      who named her only child after the one thing she believed in, was shot dead
      during a street protest against a housing development. Why? Who knows, though
      it\u2019s a brave woman who gets in the way of Blank Holdings, who stands up
      to Don Blank, but AJ\u2019s life shattered in an instant.  Lost, angry, unable
      to trust anyone \u2013 \u201Ctroubled\u201D, a state synonym for \u201Cbroken\u201D
      \u2013 he ran from homes and foster-families from before finally finding some
      kind of stability at the brothel where he first met Nero, now leader of The
      Legion."
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_AJ_03
    translation: "Teenage America channelled his rage into street combat, taking one
      lesson from his broken childhood, the code he still lives by: no-one will fight
      for you so you better learn to fight for yourself. Why does America fight? America
      fights because that\u2019s what he does best, better than anyone. That\u2019s
      all he knows."
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_AJ_04
    translation: "And that\u2019s what people pay him for: to fight in underground
      street matches where he\u2019s always the favourite. You\u2019d think he\u2019d
      make enemies that way but this isn\u2019t personal. He survives by walking the
      shifting lines that mark the turf wars of the city \u2013 fighting not for The
      Way, The Legion, The Man or The Cops, just for money and his girl. He\u2019s
      doesn\u2019t take sides, though each side would love to recruit him. But America
      doesn\u2019t believe in good or evil. He expects no favours, and he offers no
      mercy."

      to Vida and Loca by their loving \u201Cfather\u201D, Benjamins adopts its benefactor\u2019s
      signature green for its logo and accents on the fixtures and fittings. The dominant
      colours, though, are silver and black. This is a nightclub, after all."
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_BENJAMINS_03
    translation: "At the centre of the club is an octagonal arena, around 20m in diameter,
      sunken from the floor level. The dancefloor lights up to Loca\u2019s rhythms,
      as all good dancefloors should. The DJ booth \u2013 capped with a mysterious,
      illuminati-stlyled triangle \u2013 is where Vida hangs back with her record
      collection and dictates the flow of the evening. "
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_BENJAMINS_04
    translation: "A huge, expensive lighting rig hangs above the dancefloor. It looks
      like a climbing frame \u2013 you could swing on it if you got really excited,
      if the dancing got really intense, but the health and safety department wouldn\u2019t
      recommend it.  Vida wouldn\u2019t either. Break her favourite toy and she\u2019ll

      every single one of them is loaded. He carries conventional weaponry too, naturally,
      but never needs to show because he always has people with him. The Mystic is
      just one of them but you\u2019re never short of friends when you have the sort
      of money Don Blank has."

    translation: "Let\u2019s cut to the chase, the thing everyone wants to know. He
      made his money like the motherfuckers always do \u2013 by ruining the weak.
      They\u2019ll call him a property developer in the business pages, which is true,
      to a point; seems like half of Cali\u2019s being \u201Crevitalised\u201D by
      Blank Holdings. "
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_BLANK_04
    translation: "The papers say it\u2019s good for the county: land values are up,
      crime\u2019s down. But that depends on your definition of crime. If you ask
      the people who\u2019ve been kicked out of their homes, corralled into squalid
      neighborhoods on the edge of town because the crooked cops say so, well, they\u2019d
      probably give a different statistic in less polite language."
  - key: FE_EXTRAS_BLANK_05
    translation: "Ask those same people other questions, too. Ask them how Don made
      his first hundred K, ask them about the crack operation he used to run. He got
      out of that game once he\u2019d acquired enough capital to go legit, so one
      story goes; another says he\u2019s still running the game from his HQ, the penthouse
      of the tallest building downtown. Cops can\u2019t touch him there. Not that

      though, their need to impress their leader sits in opposition to the things
      that their leader wants them to learn. They need to calm down, to chill. The
      Way is about balance not urgency."
